        <h2 style="color: rgb(55, 161, 194) ; text-decoration: underline;"> <em> Who are we ?? </em></h2>
            <p>
                We are <abbr title='Solar Powered Airship Racing Team'><em>SPART</em></abbr>
                one of the latest tech teams of IIT Bombay!
                We are a bunch of enthusiastic students striving to increase the cult of airships within insti and the world.
                Well, airships are not unknown to the world. They have been around since the 1850s, but a very renowned incident, the Hindenburg disaster, almost ended the journey of these striking beauties in the 20th century.
                <strong>Airships are massive lighter-than-air systems that look like oval-shaped balloons but have engines to give them power and control their direction of movement.</strong>
                We believe one day, airships will be admired and much acknowledged owing to their glorious capabilities. They are more efficient and environmentally friendly than any modern-day air vehicle, promoting sustainable air transport.
                Also, we seek the golden opportunity to proudly represent IIT Bombay on an international platform by competing in the WSAR (World Solar Airship Race) 2023.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(55, 161, 194) ; text-decoration: underline;"> <em> Our Vision </em></h2>
            <p>
                We wish to popularize the culture of Airships within the institute and stimulate research and development of a sustainable air transport system. 
                The team mainly aims at uplifting the LTA systems, particularly the airship sector. Sustainable transportation being the need of the hour, airships 
                have an edge by being fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.

            <h3 style="color: grey ; text-decoration: underline;"> WSAR </h3>
                <p>
                    Aiming at increasing sustainable air transport and stimulating research into development of airships, World Solar Airship Race [WSAR] is primarily a design competition. 
                    The racers are student teams from universities from around the world who will race with Solar Powered Autonomous Airships across the South Atlantic from South Africa to Brazil in December 2023. 
                    The Fédération Aéronautique International / World Air Sports Federation will observe and record the results.

                    <p>
                        On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Lighter Than Air [LTA] systems lab in IIT Bombay, the lab, as a part of its global outreach, aims at gathering global experts 
                        in the field of LTA systems, and to discuss the current and future developments in this field from 22nd to 26th of June 2022. The event will host several eminent academicians, scientists and 
                        scholars from all over the globe, who have spearheaded developments in LTA technology. The conference will consist of invited talks, and presentations of contributed papers, culminating in 
                        panel discussions on issues relevant to the LTA industry.
